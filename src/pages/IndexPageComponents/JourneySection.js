      <p className="main-text">I got my first computer when I was seven, and like any good father (I suppose), mine said, “Let's break it and then learn how to fix it!”</p>

      <p className="main-text">Come 2012 and many computers later, I graduated with a BS in Marketing Management from the Sarajevo School of Business and Economics.</p>

      <p className="main-text">2014. My first real job was working for a local Bay Area bank. I was in marketing, but quickly found myself designing, building, and pushing out software tools that dramatically improved our efficiencies, productivity, and bottom line. </p>

      <p className="main-text">This experience led me to build my own software company. Our goal was to connect car dealerships and lenders into a unified, real-time lending marketplace platform with a built-in decision engine. We had a lot of passion, but quickly learned what “disruption” really means when the CEO of a major bank saw what our product could do and told me, “I hope you fail.” And we did.</p>

      <p className="main-text">But I didn't give up. I still wanted to build software and tackle the automotive industry. I opened my own car dealership in 2017 and built ALL of our core business applications from scratch, which enabled us to do $10M in sales in 2019.</p>
      <Divider />
      <p className="main-text"><strong>Through all this, I’ve learned that, while my passion lies in tackling problems with an entrepreneurial spirit and delivering truly innovative and impactful solutions, I enjoy doing these things by building great software.</strong></p>
