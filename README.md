  Hi, this is a repo for my personal website project -- <a href="https://dinohasanic.com/">dinohasanic.com</a>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Feel free to look through my code, and maybe use it as a starter idea for your own personal website.
</p>

<p align="center">
  I used GatsbyJS as a starter for this website. Full documentation for Gatsby lives <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org/">on their website</a>.
</p>

## Quick start

1. **Gatsby-CLI.**
    
    If you don't already have Gatsby CLI installed:

    ```shell
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd your-project-name/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
    
3. **Testing.**
    
    I used Cypress for testing. To run tests:

    ```shell
    cd your-project-name/
    npm run test:e2e
    ```
    
4. **Build & Serve.**
    
    When you are ready to build your code for production:

    ```shell
    cd your-project-name/
    gatsby build
    gatsby serve
    ```
    
    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:9000`!
