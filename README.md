  Dino Hasanic | Personal portfolio website
</h1>

Hi, this is a repo for my personal website project -- dinohasanic.com. Feel free to look through my code, and maybe use it as a starter idea for your own personal website.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd your-project-name/
    gatsby develop
    ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
